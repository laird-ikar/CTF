Today we need your help. The Charly's Slack staff account has been hacked and the image attached has been posted in the general channel.
At first sight, it seems to be only a joke. However, we have to unravel the identity of the person behind this possible hacking.
Are you able to find where they are living ?
The name of the city seems to have a funny connotation (if you speak french).

The flag is the name of the city (as written on Google) where the screenshot was taken put inside 42CTF{}.
Example if the city is Paris: 42CTF{Paris} (beware, it is case-sensitive).
Good luck !

Thanks to [APT42](https://github.com/apt-42) for the challenge.
