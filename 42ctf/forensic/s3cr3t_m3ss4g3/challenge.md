"Dear love, I know it's been hard for you since they put me in jail. I only get 30 minutes a day to access the internet and write you such letters. I miss you, and I deeply regret getting involved in such crimes. P.S: I really don't know what file you are talking about... But if you are referring to the one that you receive when I send you this email, is just for verification from the prison. Don't worry about it (or do)."
